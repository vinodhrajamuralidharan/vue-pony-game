# vue-pony-game
  This is a solution for the Pony challenge (https://ponychallenge.trustpilot.com/index.html) and I have developed using Vue.js

  I have created 3 components (App, Wall and Players). APP component is the base component and handles all the api calls and handles all the basic operations.
## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
To run the app 'npm run serve'
```
and to see the app, you have to open 'http://localhost:8080/', whevever you edit the code, the page will reload.

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run test:unit
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
